An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.

You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.

All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."

Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.
